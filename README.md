### Turtle Crossing Game ###
The title of this project is pretty self-explanatory. The question is:  
__Are you able to help your turtle get to the other side of the road without getting hit by the many oncoming cars? If yes, for how many levels?__

To be noted:  
* _The speed of the cars is increasing at every level._
* _The turtle is moving forward by pressing the "Up" key._
